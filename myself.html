    <div><p> <b>Hello! I'm Ashish Kumar Lucky. I am from Muzaffarpur,Bihar.I secure 8.8 CGPA in 10<sup>th</sup> standard,  63.2 % in 12<sup>th</sup>standard. I had completed by bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Motihari College of Engineering, Motihari where I secure 7.68 CGPA. My technical skills is SQL, HTML, MACHINE LEARNING and Programming in PYTHON. I also used my technical skills in my final year project which is Brain Tumor Classification using Machine Learning, <ul>
        <li><strong>In This Project:</strong></li>
           <ul type="circle">
            <li>In this machine learning project, we build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) scan images. The performance of model is predict brain tumor is present or not.
                If the tumor is detected it return yes and some details about tumor, otherwise it return no. Brain tumor detection we have studied about feature based existing work. In feature based we have study about image processing techniques likes image pre-processing, image segmentation, features extraction, classification. And also study about deep learning techniques MRI(Magnetic resonance imaging). In this system we have detect the tumor is present or not if the tumour is present then model returnâ€™s yes otherwise it return no. and we have compared MRI Images.</li>
